### About this Project
The goal of this project was to take the dataset located [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), from this [source](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and perform a series of abstractions and transformations in order to collect and clean up the dataset for later analysis.

### Goal of the Project
1. A tidy dataset
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script
